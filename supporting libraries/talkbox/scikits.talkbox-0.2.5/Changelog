	* Fix missing files in the tarball

Tue, 17 Feb 2009 17:06:53 +0900
	* Fix a serious bug in LPC wrapper: this should fix segfaults on 64
	bits arch.

Sun, 18 Jan 2009 20:55:54 +0900
	* Implemented MFCC computation
	* Assumes scipy 0.8 installed (for the DCT)

Tue, 25 Nov 2008 18:14:52 +0900
	* Release 0.2.1

Sat, 22 Nov 2008 11:01:03 +0900
	* Add a cython version of direct implementation (wo FFT)
	autocorrelation
	* Add argument to optionally use direct autocorrelation in lpcres;
	this makes lpcres several times faster for typical LPC order/windows
	size ration in speech processing.

Fri, 21 Nov 2008 20:59:57 +0900
	* Add a function slfilter in tools to filter a set of windows
	* Add a cython version of slfilter
	* Use slfilter to implement rank 2 of linpred

Wed, 5 Nov 2008 04:13:05 +0900
	* Fix some major memory leaks in levinson C code
	* Fix DCT with fft backend
	* Release 0.2

Thu, 25 Sep 2008 01:38:44 +0900
	* Fix bug in levinson error computation (data given to
	PyArray_NewFromData was not allocated on the heap).
	* Autocorrelation now is the biased estimator (fix discrepancy with
	matlab for lpc)
	* Initial version of arspec
	* Better error handling of input errors in C levinson

Tue, 23 Sep 2008 01:50:27 +0900

	* levinson is implemented in both python and C (C only support real
	double; python version can do complex numbers)
	* lpc implemented (support axis argument)
	* simple periodogram implemented
	* 0.1 release
