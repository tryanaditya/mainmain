    This is mostly useful for processing on a set of windows with variable
    filters, e.g. to compute LPC residual from a signal chopped into a set of
    windows.

    ----------

        a: array
            non-recursive coefficients
        x: array

    This is a specialized function, and does not handle initial conditions,
