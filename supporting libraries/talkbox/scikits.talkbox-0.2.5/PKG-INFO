Description: Talkbox, to make your numpy environment speech aware !
        
        Talkbox is set of python modules for speech/signal processing. The goal of this
        toolbox is to be a sandbox for features which may end up in scipy at some
        point. The following features are planned before a 1.0 release:
        
        * Spectrum estimation related functions: both parametic (lpc, high
        resolution methods like music and co), and non-parametric (Welch,
        periodogram)
        * Fourier-like transforms (DCT, DST, MDCT, etc...)
        * Basic signal processing tasks such as resampling
        * Speech related functionalities: mfcc, mel spectrum, etc..
        * More as it comes
        
        I want talkbox to be useful for both research and educational purpose. As such,
        a requirement is to have a pure python implementation for everything - for
        educational purpose and reproducibility - and optional C for speed.
