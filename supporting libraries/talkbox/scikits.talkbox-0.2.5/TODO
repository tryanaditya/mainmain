Release 0.2
===========

Spectrogram estimation:
	- tapping, daniel smoothing should work (See Bloomfield)
        - add plotting capabilities to periodogram
        - AR spectrum estimation (again with plotting)

Documentation for periodogram + examples
Documentation for LPC + examples
Documentation for Levinson

Release 0.3
===========

Implement real cepstrum
...

Release 1.0
===========

Have major transform implemented: dct II/IV, MDCT.
Have periodogram, aryule and at least one high-resolution method for spectrum
(MUSIC ?)
Have good-performance LPC-analysis.

Future
======

- More parametric spectrum estimation
- Polyphase filters ?
